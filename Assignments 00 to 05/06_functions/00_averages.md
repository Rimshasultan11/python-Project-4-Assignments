## How It Works 🤖
- The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
- It calculates the average using the formula:
  ```
  average = (num1 + num2) / 2
  ```
- The result is printed on the screen.

---

## Python Code 📝
```python
def main():
    num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
    average = (num1 + num2) / 2
    print("The average is:", average)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Example Output 
If the user inputs:
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 20
```
Output will be:
