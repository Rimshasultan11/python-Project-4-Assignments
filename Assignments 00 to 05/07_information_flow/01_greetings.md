# Greet User 🌟

## Problem Statement
This program is designed to prompt the user for their name and then greet them using the `greet()` function. The program takes the name as input and prints a personalized greeting.

---

## How It Works 🤖
- The program prompts the user to enter their name.
- It then calls the `greet(name)` function, which prints a greeting message with the user's name.

---

## Python Code 📝
```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Greetings {name}!")

def main():
    name = input("What's your name? ")
    greet(name)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

---

### Example Output 💻
For the user input `Rimsha`, the output will be:
```
What's your name? Rimsha
Greetings Rimsha
```
