# 🚀 Liftoff Countdown Program

## 🔎 Problem Statement
This Python program simulates a spaceship launch countdown. The goal is to count down from 10 to 1 and then print "Liftoff!" ✨. This is a great example of using loops in Python for repetitive tasks.


## 📚 How It Works
- The `for` loop is used to iterate backwards from 10 to 1.
- After the loop finishes, it prints "Liftoff!" to signal the end of the countdown.

## Code Implementation 
```python
def main():
    # Countdown from 10 to 1
    for i in range(10, 0, -1):
        print(i)
    print("Liftoff!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
