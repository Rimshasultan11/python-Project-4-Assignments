# Affirmation Repetition Program

This Python program repeatedly prompts the user to type a specific affirmation until it is entered correctly. The affirmation is meant to boost motivation and positivity. The user will be gently reminded to try again until they input the affirmation exactly as required.

## Program Code
```python
def main():
    affirmation = "I am capable of doing anything I put my mind to."
    print(f"Please type the following affirmation: {affirmation}")
    
    while True:
        user_input = input()
        if user_input == affirmation:
            print("That's right! :)")
            break
        else:
            print("Hmmm That was not the affirmation. Please try again:")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()


 
```
