## 🔧 How It Works
1️⃣ The user is prompted to enter the **first number**.  
2️⃣ The input is read and converted into an **integer**.  
3️⃣ The user is prompted to enter the **second number**.  
4️⃣ The input is read and converted into an **integer**.  
5️⃣ The sum of the two numbers is calculated.  
6️⃣ The result is displayed with an appropriate message.

## 🖥️ Code Implementation
```python
# Define the main function
def main():
    # Prompt user for first number
    num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    
    # Prompt user for second number
    num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
    
    # Calculate the sum
    total = num1 + num2
    
    # Display the result
    print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {total}")

# Call the main function
main()
```
